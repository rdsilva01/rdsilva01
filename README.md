Currently I'm in my 3rd year of Computer Science and Engineering at UBI (Portugal).

In here I could say what I've learned academically and personally, but I prefer to demonstrate it, so feel free to check my repositories, and if anything comes up, don't hesitate to send me a message, through an email or any other way really.
