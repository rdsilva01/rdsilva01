## Hey there, I'm Rodrigo, from Portugal ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹!

I'm a computer science and engineering student with a passion for programming, cars, and music. As part of my studies, I'm currently learning a variety of programming languages, such as Java, OCaml, C, Javascript. Also learning C# by myself! 

I'm excited to continue my studies and explore new areas of programming. As I develop my skills, I'm always looking for new and exciting projects to work on. Feel free to check out my GitHub repositories and reach out if you have any questions or just want to say hi!

Let's connect and share our passion for programming, cars, and music!
