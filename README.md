Currently I'm in my 3rd year of Engenharia Informática [Computer Science and Engineering] @ UBI [Portugal].

Interested in the creation of minimalistic but user friendly systems.

In here I could say what I've learned academically and personally, but I prefer to demonstrate it, so feel free to check my repositories, and if anything comes up, don't hesitate to send me a message, through an email or any other way really.
