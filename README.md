## Hey there, I'm Rodrigo, from Portugal ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹!
---

Currently I'm in my 3rd year of Computer Science and Engineering at UBI (Portugal). I share an interest in Web and Applications development. Academically I've learned several programming languages such as Java, OCaml, C, C#, Javascript (and some frameworks of it). At the moment I'm learning Flutter (Android development), C++ (For graphical interfaces), SQL (DBMS) and Python (AI).
I consider myself a fast learner and I really enjoy working on a team, to develop myself personally and professionally.
Feel free to check on my repositories and anything just send me a message!
